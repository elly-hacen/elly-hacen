# ü¶• About Me

Hello there! I'm **Elie**, a Python developer at **IPI**, skilled in Django and DRF. I have created and implemented **multi-tenant architecture for schools** and work on **Agentic**, where I fine-tune AI models, prepare learning datasets, and validate interactions between tools to ensure workflows actually work.

When I get bored, I read **Rust docs**, a language I picked up to balance my life. Little secret: if I only knew Python, life would be too easy, so I learned a low-level language too ü¶•. I also rewrote **Treko**, a company Python desktop app, in Rust, improving CPU efficiency from 40‚Äì50% down to 0.3‚Äì1%.
